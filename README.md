Hello! My name is Josh. I'm a hobbist developer for about 10 years now, primaraly a web developer. I've recently branched out to many other types of code though - I've worked with Raspberry pi's, cross-platform flutter apps, automation/scripting, C# and ASP.NET, Rust, and with new additions of AOSP via building my own rom, and LUA via writing my own modular Neovim config and even authoring a plugin for Neovim. Development is a way of life and I can't wait to see where it takes me in the future!
